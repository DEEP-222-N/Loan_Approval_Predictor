This project involves building a machine learning-based web application that predicts the approval status of loan applications based on user input. The app was developed using supervised learning techniques and deployed using Flask, with a clean and responsive frontend built using HTML and CSS.

The application enables users to input key applicant details such as gender, marital status, applicant income, loan amount, employment status, credit history, and property area. Based on this data, the trained model predicts whether the loan is likely to be approved or not.

Key highlights:

Supervised learning model trained on a labeled dataset of past loan approvals

Preprocessing steps included handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features

User-friendly input form that collects essential loan-related parameters

Real-time prediction displayed instantly after submission

Clean UI design with a responsive layout for smooth user experience

Tech stack:

Python and Scikit-learn for model training and inference

Flask for backend API and routing

HTML and CSS for building the frontend

Pandas and NumPy for data preprocessing and feature handling

Pickle for saving and loading the trained model
